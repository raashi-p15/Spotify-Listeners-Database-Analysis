This project analyzes a spotify dataset through Structures Query Language.<br>
Normalization of the database has been done to provide a structure to the data, improve data integrity and avoid redundant values<br>
Sql queries of varying levels have been executed<br>
Query optimization has been done to improve performance during execution<br>
Valuable insights have been generated<br>

<h2>Details about the dataset </h2>
This dataset has been downloaded from Kaggle. It hosts a variety of attributes such as artists, tracks, albums, playlists, likes, views, comments, titles, and other parameters of the respective tracks and albums from Spotify, a music streaming company. It has already been cleaned and uplaoded.
<h2>Project Steps</h2>
<h3>1. Understanding the dataset : <b>Data Exploration</b><br></h3>
To understand the metrics and attributes of the date before going into sql queries, we take a look at the csv file containing the database. We analyze it and grasp the parameters. We also check it for duplicates through Select All>Data>Remove Duplicates in Microsoft Excel. We find that no duplicates exist in the dataset since it has been already cleaned. We move ahead to importing this data on pgAdmin 4.<br>
